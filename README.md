# TicTacToe
Terminal Tic Tac Toe written in Python for Mr. Stroops programming class.

Tic-tac-toe is traditionally a paper-and-pencil game for 
two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in
a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of 
their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row 
wins the game.

In this version, statistics are kept based on which player wins, and the data is displayed after every game.
